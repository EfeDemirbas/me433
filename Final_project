The aim with this design was to make the robot as slim as possible while still not looking like a tower of components and looks like something that can drive.

The final mechanical design took two iterations, some parts needed to be adjusted for tolerances and the cone effect of the lazer, but overall the parts are small and the whole print fits into about 1/5th of an acrylic sheet.
